## **Privacy Policy**

### **Last Updated: [Insert Date]**

At **LockBox**, we take your privacy seriously. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect your personal information when you use our services, including the password generator, encryption tools, image-to-Base64 converter, alias generator, and QR code generator.

### **1. Information We Collect**
We aim to limit the personal information we collect. **LockBox** does not collect, store, or share any personal data unless explicitly provided by you for customer support or communication purposes.

- **Automatically Generated Data**: When using our password generator or encryption services, all password and encryption-related activities happen locally on your device. We do not have access to your passwords or encrypted data.
- **User Data**: We do not collect or store your passwords, encryption phrases, or any other sensitive information. All sensitive operations happen within your device's environment and are not transmitted to our servers.

### **2. Use of Cookies**
Our service does not use cookies for tracking or marketing purposes. However, if you use additional features like saving data on your device (e.g., using localStorage or IndexedDB), you may need to agree to use these features, which are solely for enhancing your user experience.

### **3. How We Use Your Information**
We may collect non-personal usage statistics to improve our services. This includes data on the number of users visiting the site or using specific features, but it does not include any personally identifiable information.

### **4. Data Security**
We prioritize the security of your information:
- We do not store any sensitive data on our servers.
- Passwords and secret phrases are processed locally on your device to ensure that no one, including us, can access them.
- Any communications you initiate with us (via email or other means) are kept confidential and secure.

### **5. Third-Party Services**
We do not share any user data with third-party services or advertisers. However, some third-party services (e.g., Cloudflare for hosting) may be used for site functionality, and they may collect anonymous usage statistics for their purposes.

### **6. Your Consent**
By using our services, you agree to this Privacy Policy. If we make any significant changes to our Privacy Policy, we will update this page and notify users as required.

### **7. Contact Us**
